# 🎯 Landing Your Next Role  

---

## 🌍 I. The New Landscape

- Personalization is expected—Netflix, Spotify, Amazon…  
- So why not your career search?  
- Generative AI isn’t the future of job hunting.  
It’s the *present* opportunity.

---

## With the Help of Generative AI

> “It’s no longer about having *a* resume. It’s about having *the right* resume—for *this* company, *this* role, and *this* person.”

---

# 🧾 II. The Myth of  
## The One-Size-Fits-All Resume

- Spraying the same resume everywhere doesn't work.  
- ATS and AI filters scan for *exact* matches.  
- You must tailor each application to the role.

---

## ✨ How GenAI Helps

- Matches your resume to the job description.  
- Rewrites experiences using the employer’s language.  
- Highlights the most relevant skills and projects.

---

# 🔍 III. The Disconnect

### HR Filters vs. Hiring Manager Expectations

- HR may not understand the technical role.  
- Hiring managers scan 100+ resumes for key skills.  
- Transferable skills often go unrecognized.

---

## ✨ How GenAI Helps

- Translates your experience into job-relevant terms.  
- Bridges the gap between what you’ve done  
and what they’re asking for.  
- Reframes adjacent skills in familiar language.

---

# 🏢 IV. Get Noticed

### Personalize for the Company, Role, and Interviewer

- Mention the company’s goals or recent news.  
- Speak to their mission and culture.  
- Show that this role wasn’t just “next on your list.”

---

## ✨ How GenAI Helps

- Summarizes company values and updates.  
- Drafts personal intros or messages.  
- Aligns your story to their priorities.

---

## Showcase Your Skills Where It Matters

- ✅ Your resume isn’t the only thing being scanned  
- 🔍 Recruiters and AI screeners check **LinkedIn first**  
- 📌 Pin your **top 3 skills** that align with your target role  
- ✍️ Add **project examples or posts** that prove your skills  
- 🔁 Keep skills consistent across **resume, one-pager, and LinkedIn**  
- 🤖 Generative AI tools and screeners use **keywords** — help them find you  
- 🚀 The clearer your skills, the stronger your personal brand

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**

This slide is about visibility. When you're job hunting, it's not just about having a strong resume — it's about making sure your skills are visible *where people and AI look first.*

LinkedIn is often the first stop for recruiters and hiring systems. If your skills aren’t listed there, you’re missing opportunities.

You can “pin” your top 3 skills on your LinkedIn profile — make sure these match what employers are searching for in your target roles. Reinforce them by mentioning them in project descriptions, posts, and endorsements.

And remember: consistency is key. Your resume, one-pager, and LinkedIn profile should all tell the same story. That helps both humans and algorithms understand who you are and what you're good at.

This is one of the easiest ways to help Generative AI tools help *you.*

# 🎤 V. Interview Readiness

### Thinking ≠ Speaking

- Interviews are performance-based.  
- Clarity, tone, and delivery matter just as much as content.  
- Practice makes polish.

---

## ✨ How GenAI Helps

- Simulates interviews using voice.  
- Gives feedback on your responses and tone.  
- Adapts to behavioral, technical, and situational styles.

---

# 🤝 VI. Networking Wins Jobs

- 70–80% of roles are landed through networking.  
- Real connections > cold applications.  
- Meetups, conferences, and conversations matter.

---

## 🌟 Build Your Social Proof

- 📊 **LinkedIn recommendations** validate your skills & work style  
- 🎯 **Ask strategically** from managers, peers, and clients  
- 💡 **Be specific:** "Could you highlight our work on [specific project]?"  
- 🔄 **Offer to write** a draft they can edit (makes it easier)  
- ⏱️ **Schedule reminders** to build recommendations quarterly  
- 🤖 **Use GenAI** to craft personalized recommendation requests

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**

Social proof is powerful. When others vouch for you, it builds instant credibility with hiring managers and recruiters. LinkedIn recommendations are particularly valuable because they're public and tied to real professional profiles.

Be strategic about who you ask - aim for a mix that showcases different skills and relationships. The key is making it easy for people to help you - offering to draft something they can edit saves them time while ensuring you highlight specific achievements.

GenAI can help you craft personalized, thoughtful requests that respect the other person's time while clearly stating what aspect of your work you'd like them to highlight.
-->

---

## ✨ How GenAI Helps

- Finds relevant local meetups and virtual events.  
- Drafts outreach messages and follow-ups.  
- Helps you stay polished and memorable.
- **Creates personalized recommendation requests.**

---

# 🛠 VII. Bonus Uses of GenAI

- Drafts LinkedIn posts to boost your visibility.  
- Recommends job titles and paths based on your skills.  
- Creates networking and thank-you messages.

---

# 💡 VIII. Closing Thought

> “Generative AI doesn’t replace *you*—it helps present the best *version* of you.”

It’s not about removing the human touch.  
It’s about enhancing it—with clarity, consistency, and confidence.

---

# 🙌 Thank You!

**Let’s talk about how you can apply this today.**  
What’s one area in your job search where AI could help *right now*?

---

## IX. Search Yourself with Generative AI

- 🔍 Ask AI: “What do you know about [Your Name]?”  
- 🌐 Try prompts like:  
  - “Summarize the professional profile of [Your Name]”  
  - “What jobs might [Your Name] be qualified for based on public info?”  
- 🧠 Use tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity for neutral analysis  
- 🎯 Evaluate what shows up — does it align with your goals?  
- 📉 If nothing relevant appears, it’s time to **boost your digital footprint**  
- 📢 Share your work, skills, and updates to shape your narrative

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**

This is a fun and revealing exercise. Use a Generative AI tool like ChatGPT or Perplexity and simply ask: "What do you know about [Your Name]?" Or go a little deeper — "Based on what you find online, what roles might I be suited for?"

Why do this? Because it gives you a mirror into how you’re being seen — not just by people, but by algorithms. If what comes up doesn’t reflect your real strengths or interests, that’s a signal to take action.

Start sharing more of your work publicly. Write posts about your projects, update your skills, and make your achievements visible. This helps you *own* your narrative before someone else defines it for you.
-->


## 🎯 Don’t Just Say “I Don’t Know”

**❌ Avoid:**  
> “I don’t know that.”

**✅ Instead Say:**  
> “I haven’t used that specific tool, but I worked with a similar one in a past project. Here’s how I approached it...”

**🎯 Why:**  
Shows adaptability, experience, and a growth mindset.

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**
This strategy keeps you in the conversation. Rather than shutting down the topic, you demonstrate your problem-solving ability and transferable skills. It shows that you're resourceful and coachable.
-->

---

## 🤝 Ask the Right Questions

**🔍 About the Job:**  
> “Are there other skills or experiences you’re looking for that aren’t in the job description?”

**🗺️ About the Process:**  
> “Can you walk me through what the interview process will look like?”

**💡 Why:**  
Uncovers hidden expectations and helps you prepare for different types of interviews — technical, behavioral, or cultural fit.

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**
Interviewers don’t always have time to revisit or update job descriptions. Asking these questions shows your initiative and ensures a better match. It also sets the stage for deeper, more relevant conversations.
-->

---

## 🎥 Be Present in Video Interviews

- Look into the camera  
- Place the interviewer’s video near your webcam  
- Treat it like an in-person meeting  
- **Don’t read from your screen — it shows**  
- Be genuine and conversational in your responses

**👀 Why:**  
This builds trust, demonstrates confidence, and makes you more memorable.

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**
Your engagement on camera reflects your professionalism. Reading off a script may be tempting, but it’s obvious and lessens your impact. Instead, prepare ahead and speak naturally — the goal is real human connection.
-->

---

## 🧠 Tell *Your* Story, Not Just the Project

**✅ Give quick context**  
**✅ Focus on your personal contributions**  
**✅ Highlight outcomes or lessons learned**

**🛠️ Why:**  
Interviewers want to understand *your* value.

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**
It’s easy to get caught in “we” statements when discussing a team project, but hiring managers are evaluating *you*. Make sure your contributions and problem-solving approach are clear and measurable.
-->

---

## 🧭 Frame Your Journey Positively

**❌ Don’t Say:**  
> “I hated working in finance, so I left.”

**✅ Do Say:**  
> “Working in finance gave me valuable experience and helped me discover that I’m more passionate about technology.”

**🎯 Why:**  
- Keeps the tone professional  
- Shows reflection and growth  
- Avoids negativity while highlighting your direction

**💬 Tip:** Every pivot in your career is part of your story — tell it with purpose and optimism.

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**
Negative talk about past jobs or managers can be a red flag. Even if a job was tough, there’s always something you learned. Framing your path with positivity shows maturity and helps interviewers envision your future.
